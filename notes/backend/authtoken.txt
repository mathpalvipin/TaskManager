An authentication token (auth token) is a computer-generated code that verifies a userâ€™s identity. Auth tokens are used to access websites, applications, services, and application programming interfaces (APIs). They allow users to access these resources without having to re-enter their login credentials each time they visit.

###Advantages of auth tokens include:

Scalability: Authentication tokens are easily scalable and self-contained, providing all the information needed for authentication. This is great for scalability as it frees your server from having to store session state.
Flexibility: Authentication tokens can be generated from anywhere.
Security: Auth tokens provide an extra layer of security and can be expired or revoked. They provide better protection against attack scenarios like brute-force attacks or stolen passwords.

###Auth tokens can be hardware or software-based. Some types of authentication tokens include: 
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (i.e., bearer tokens, self-signed JWTs)
Refresh tokens
Federated tokens
One-time password (OTP) tokens
API tokens
